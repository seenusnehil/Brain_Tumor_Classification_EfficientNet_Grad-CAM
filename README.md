# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification with EfficientNet and Grad-CAM  

This project focuses on developing a **deep learning-based approach** for classifying brain tumors using **EfficientNet**, a highly efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), combined with **Grad-CAM** visualizations to improve interpretability.  

The goal is to create a system that not only classifies brain tumors accurately but also provides visual insights into the model's decision-making process, aiding in transparency and trustworthiness for potential medical applications.
